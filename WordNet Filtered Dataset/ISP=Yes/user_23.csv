I will leave soon. Rafinha ki news de chatuh fatafati
yep yep this one will drag till the end for sure
you can sleep bronothing gonna happen lmao we will probably concede another
i dont think they will really survive till the end of the season
was not there a report a few days ago that fiorentina will not sell to them because of what happened with chiesa
the incompetency to cover in midfield is probably the reason we will not be at wembley
madarchod lacazette will complete the bozo challenge by getting a red
agree with you tbhalso we need a striker to even have a shot our youngsters will surely lose their go
it will be
exactly if spurs beat rennes they will be busy in europe too along with west ham and united we jus
the thing is he will reject us
i do not think he is getting sacked anytime soon this mess will be even worse than what we were left with after emery
he will be docked points surely if it happens
i knew it before it was being taken ki martinez will save it he is mega at pens
the lunatics will be discussing mike dean and individual errors we are now coming up to years of watching a manager inca
the thing is the incompetency the management has here i feel like even after we sack him we will make t
football can be so cruel but for your personality for your character for your bravery we will always be proud of you a
how much money will the punishment brother make
will not be seeing him until at least one half of the season apparently sign
i doubt west ham will lose both games
the thing you will miss the most from london askmesut
he will ball in the championship ngl
lacazette and willian will not be dropped either broidk what arteta sees in these clowns
dude he will be against jack harrison after the break ffss that leeds intensity will destroy uss ffs
he will mp
not sure about that one chief but i will legit lose my mind if his contract is extended
till when will these defensive errors cost us over and over again
currently having my internals and this app is the reason i will score some marks in these examscan legit find video for any topic
but i heard somewhere that they will not get the ban
if dembele somehow signs for in this transfer window even on loan i will buy anyone who retweets this the new ar
thank you for k followers we will be giving away one of these england tops of the winners choice when we hit k follo
why would he leave a club on the rise to join a dusted clubi stg these positivity merchants ffs
leave asap
can not translate
randi ka baccha ref not giving us a single foul
not as bad as laca ffs so many bad decisions
they really think we can get top with lacazette and nketiah nah i really did not think they are that retarded but i guess they are
i wonder how tf are the board not looking at how are we selling our assets other than joe willock who
teta am not reintegrating him into the squad ghis ego is too big for that
is not that the case always lmao
i really do not think he is ready yet though very conservative on the ball and it feels like his confide
lack of fitness among many players did not help either
the tactics are not helping either odegaard loves to have time on the ball which he is not getting an
tomi does not look sharp
i mean why is our fanbase working so hard to defend arteta i really do not get this
not worth for this club bro
he am not going anywhere sadly
do not compare this project to jurgen klopp's at liverpool ever again he played attacking football from day made cl footb
rather than talking more about the challenge they are saying that he does not have a track record hen
is not that what our tactic has been all season other than maybe spurs villawe try to score early
should not be this naive after scoringthumbs up
chutiyapa happening from the team overall thothey should not be controlling the game that much
i do not feel confident at all
saka also not fit which means pensive face
they literally did not have of their best players todayjust horrible to watch
the difference is this madarchod is not getting sacked anytime soon sigh
we are not climbing the table with him as the coach either thumbs up
i think it is more of an ego issue probably does not want to be second fiddle to neymar or messi
yeah i do not give two shits about what other fans think but we all need to get behind the
ignore them clowns gi'm dreading the new season rn we might not even make top at this point
copying it g football is not for me
it is not coming this year thoyoutube announced it a while back
we are not a big club g
we am not winning shit g lol
we am not signing anyone this club is run by a bunch of clowns
do not fucking renew the contract of that clown
this is arsenal's biggest day in the last years and they did not even play tonight
not gonna lie but i do think he might be using the links to get a bigger contract at leicester
this too xhaka's absence was not why we were not winning his return is not why we lost laughing with a friend does not mean anyth
actually my brother is a city fan so he showed me a tweet of some credible source regarding it i am not sure that its true tho
ffs man do not pray injury to him even if you do not like him
band aids do not fix bullet holes
not for science students like expressionless face
no point watching anyways
no way has this happened man unreal
and no concrete links for any problem position man days left ffs
read somewhere there is no fee involved
no control whatsoever
no
city have no answers ffs
no energy at all
no changes bc what a clown this guy bc
shot on target tonight wins in in the league no definitive style or plan negative goal difference no improvemen
in all honesty i think both were yellow challenges but the thing is i have never seen a ref give a red this way
never thought someone can be this retarded
it is almost as if the season never ended same rubbish players same slow playing out from the back same clueless man
things never went this bad under emery mann ffs
i have never been this scared of a nldspurs are having a field day next sunday
lack of cutting edge and ingenuity in the attack killed us never want to see lacazette start for us again √∂zil must be sol
nothing is done yet bro it is a very long window fingers crossed tho
head up auba his bicycle kick got us a goal from nothing and we really should have held on everyone misses chances and au
both of them are so punchable man ffs

it feels so bad to say it but we really are mid table now
this madarchod has spent around million this summer and people still have excuses for himwe are so mid table

yess so wholesome to watch
i mean he can tbhbut i guess i read this somewhere that he hates the weather in england so i feel li
we are so clear anyways
he has been so ass man
wtf was that ffshow were they opened up so easily

enough is enough this guy is so fucking clueless artetaout
this club gives me so much stress ffs
auba has been so so bad today ffs
leeds are so so bad at defending set pieces lmao
this is so so painful
i honestly cannot watch this game anymore fam it is so so bad ffs
we are so fucking clueless in possession
fair play to liverpool man they are so so clear i need arsenal to be like that soon this reality check was needed
genuinely feel so bad for messi sigh
so true ffs
i am so proud of the boys today the season has been so toxic and even after arteta came in they have had a lot of tough

all this athletic pr only for him to get smoked by emery
if only he would have stayed injury free sigh
if only depay or ekambi finished any of those early chances
only one invincibles trophy
yeah but important games coming need reinforcements badly
but wont that a horrible pr move for max and rb media would kill them i think
i think this happened a few months ago but a very weird career shift lmao from a f team principal to this
honestly this is all on the recruitment teamthe thing is we have spent a decent money but the recruitm
brentford were better and deserved itprobably deserved a rd as wellwe could have had but that is pre
ofc portugal are out but at least they tried to get a goal we needed to get goal at home and we was playing the ball back
have been defending him since he signed but now enough is enough thumbs up
watford are my club from now onwards thanks for the depression but it is time to say goodbye
i am going to give random people who retweet this normally i would give one person but i want to give you guys
exactly
exactly what i thinkholding gandu actually deserved to be off
what rule did he breach exactly something related to letting him pass
exactly lmao wont watch any game of this dajjal institution until atleast next season
exactly very smart move from him to win the pen
exactly what i was thinking he is running out of timehe needs to start putting in some performances
exactly what i was thinking all their forwards are midgets ffs
what about walcott and ings terrorising holding
police car light arsenal have reached an agreement with manchester city to sign striker gabriel jesus for ¬£ m still some bits to sor
i think this car is of some random guy in london
regardless of his wage or your opinion on his ability granit xhaka is human too some of the comments he receives are
as it is christmas day roma admin wants say a special thank you to all of our followers by giving away some cool asroma pre
thing is most of the fanbase directed their anger against the club upon him
this is what annoys me the most we legit lost to a team of scrubs

the sooner we replace xhaka the bettertho i agree a midfielder can be looked upon in the summe
ffs man need a midfielder asap
cork and westwood would give them a nightmare ffs
vlahovic is a mustwe need a goalscorer at all costs also suddenly squad looks very thin even after
sign Vlahovic and a midfielder like that
we were actually getting too loud maybe this is a reality check for everyone multiple issues to fix days remaining
one more poor tackle and he gets a red ffs
they have the best chance yeah one thing might be a problem that all their big games except nld are aw
nah man shipping out niles without replacement was such a bad move
we have been suffering a lot manand few weeks ago i really thought this season might be differents
what a gift win for them today probably kickstarts their season
tavares is a massive freak imo
they celebrated it like it was a last minute winner against prime barca
this is a massive shitshow
goat driver obviously got and possibly to show for thatjust need a new winner this year
ramsdale is a bigger priority brostar-struck
would be such a scary sight for defenders ffs
