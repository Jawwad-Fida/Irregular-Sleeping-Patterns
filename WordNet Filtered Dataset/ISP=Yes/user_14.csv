Your father and your father see something that does not speak to me not a day when they will see anything
real ones will always be there for you
at the end real ones never leave
May Allah compensate us with the most beautiful always

i pretend to ignore but sometimes i really miss you
i spend my nights thinking about you
one song makes you remember a lot
can i get a hey i miss you from you
i miss having someone to talk to all night
missing that one person
I miss someone I'm supposed to miss
I mean they change me in general
going into single
i want to be someone's favorite person
i cannot wait until i see you again pensive face pensive face pensive face
how i say i miss you without saying
i really need new people in my life
i wish we could fix things rather than losing each other forever
