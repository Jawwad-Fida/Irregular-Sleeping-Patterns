you are the memory i reach for in the darkness of night
please rest your head on my shoulder i have got you x
i have your name carved on my tongue every time i go to speak
i have rolled over and played dead for the final time tonight
i wish i made sense
sometimes i inherit the sunset
i wish you peace
i live inside the arts
i have outgrown my chrysalis
i feel the same way disappointed face
my daughter said in her world book day challenge that i was her literary hero and i am taking that accolade with me to my grave
i need it
if i close my eyes everything is ok
i am old school i would rather hand wash the dishes
the sky is busy littered with asteroids planets and satellites and i miss you
i can see my house from here gorgeous picture x

i think you are beautiful pass it on
i wish my skin was thicker
i need peace of mind and seven clear hours in my tattooist's chair
i am in your boot let us do this x
i am physically incapable of posting inspirational tweetsbut if pressed i can post survival tweets
i lay often between chaos and the night
i think of you in the same way that grass clings to my thighs in the balmy days of summer
where the sunset is where you and i should be
i am in the mood for you
people should stop what they are doing and make-out more often
we need prince now more than ever
more robust disappointed face
he was my first crush
deliver me from this shit
the whites of my eyes are brighter than the crest of this damn wave
fucking same and rinse the glasses under hot water
my mind needs to get lost
same friend x
madam poison of darkness pleased to meet your acquaintance x
each day brings me less to believe in and less to let go of
each day brings less to believe in
it is written in the clouds take my hand and look up
please take me with you that sounds dreamy
its hard to stay focused when my dog is always calling
the music always sets me free
stop turning me on please
when the music ends stay with me and share the silence
mine were both nursed and refused pacifiers period rude
where does my body end and my ache begin
clapping hands
this could be nothingbut look lively this could be everything
look up
sweetheart x
oh how they come and go crescent moon
you win
be kind kill me softly and slowly
yes x
yes
oh yes
you can exchange my blood for fire it is ok everything's fine
it is ok to still be human gentle reminder
