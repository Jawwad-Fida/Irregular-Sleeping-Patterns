nd half we did not want it that is all there is to it
yeah not our night
please do not be shit tomorrow bro
do not think i have seen a team be this clueless
if he was a man united signing you would somehow hear something about a work permit not allowing him to play until february
this was always one of the things i enjoyed too next to making sure we did not conceided any goals always looking forward fo
whenever ddg is in god mode we are in shit mode also i do not think rr's system is actually gonna work in any way
i do not get it also idk what rashford did to start today but he needs to play off the left too
i do not like this formation
you am not got the juice pruyne pal
do not believe truth-false man that is it
it is completely logical for them to want that we are not a threat to them anymore lol treyout
weeks not watching fred
we am not scoring with on the pitch man does nothing
we could have won the game but things do not always go your way and players lose their heads that is where ma
lukaku bullied himself after getting a ransom of money at united he cared less about his weight and was not much intereste
in lemar am not it
not another loan buy him
they are gonna sack arteta are not they disappointed face
not a foul that
that is not a penalty
england have southgate not tuchel or pep relax
what we should not rule out is a cb and dm it is clear that we do not lack goals atm
williams does not play with his head ffs so shit
spotify guy made that too public personally do not think our owners are gonna sell the club anytime so
martin atkinson motm for me for not letting them take that fucking corner at the end
no bad attitude players
no uel i repeat no uel for us
there is no need of making international friendly's this competitive no wonder there are so many injuries
forwards in and no crosses
icardi wins it they were lacking the no all game
neymar taking pens over messi oh no
someone told me there was a no curse at united once smirking face
it felt like no one apart from bruno and cavani were interested these boys better show up in the final
there is no commentary
football is dull nowadays no fans no goals no fun points though
a reason why these lot can never manage a football club and can only come and act stupid on tv
give fred the red get him on a plane to brazil i never want to see this mf again
there is been some alliances formed we never thought we would see this week to fight the esl proposal sky uefa boris johnson

the top four best films of so far
so man united planned to get cdm forward cb this year and then started off by de jong so confusing this club
checo was so unlucky again was podium bound pensive face
that is so unlucky
what a shit half from us so far
hall of fame performance so far from pastor
performance today might earn him a place but have to see who he replaces we play upfront now so it suits him too
i want ole to turn it around so much pensive face
so much attacking talent yet england are the most boring team to watch in international football southgate ball stinks
pogba's passing is so aesthetically beautiful man
so atleti are winning the liga again
so are arsenal
so fake
telles is so shit man
this dzeko fella is so annoying
man he is so dusted cannot even chat shit properly
griezmann literally plays in bruno's pos and bruno is way better then him rn
if only walker could cross the ball
assna losing but my team is shit
inappropriate language gets you a ban afaik but he seems to always curse in hindi and now this idk how he gets away tbh
he is been piss poor but goals ridiculous
offside but ddg you have feet mate you can move
saved a certain goal vs wolves almost as important as daves one today but offensive liability as alwa
it is a dive for sure but a clever one he wanted the pen and got it
they are twisting his words now to make him look bad but guess what many fans absolutely slandered him for saying
a sheikh or an oligarch anyone but americans
deano saved us tonight but watch him play ddg against city
say what you want about the ref that is an awful dogshite performance from us as usual
need to clear out some of the grandpas first vai we had grandpas on the pitch chasing a goal against atm
need some luck man
why is this random man twerking have some shame
belgium playing some champagne footy
still sold players for twice their worth almost gonna sell these players too gradually we are out here giving pointless loans
he almost missedpoor goalkeeping
most assists on uclmost chances created in uclmost big chances created in uclportuguese magnifico top hat
he put an arsenal player out there in cl final
there was a touch from fabinho man this is getting manipulated man
d chess by cr there

what a goal by griezman beautiful
all over the place city gonna have a field day if they play like this
for a year old this is unbelievable if he was in bundesliga or ligue he had be worth m by now
should have been a goal stupid decision
what a finish what a playa fire
erm that's a lot of work
what a goal what a player
if a united player dropped this mbappe disasterclass man
what a pass absurd shot that
what a snoozefest though
we are gonna see a lot of that fire
a team leaving out jadon sancho twice must be phenomenal in attack
chelsea surely getting top it is gonna be a test for both west ham and leicester united
definitely a pen
g a in a europan semi-final
his shots are like bullets what a player we have
what a madman cavaniii
what a finish fire
messi is still a genius goatglazersout
super league was a blessing in disguise afterall
it is a pain to watch this team try and play football nowadays
when bruno has the ball is space make a run that is it
liam gallagher is as irrelevant as the club he supports
what day of football this has been this is what we stay awake all night for
get one ball to ronaldo challenge
chelsea have sold every single one their deadwood while we cannot sell one people here on twitter making murtough f
