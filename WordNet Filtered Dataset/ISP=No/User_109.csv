just to make it clear not saying this is all bad i'm saying i do not know whether it is good or bad but in busine
i do not often do this yet your help is appreciatedthe mother of a good friend of mine at the young age of is vict
yeah that is a good shout but being a starter does not mean he has to play every game from
raphinha would be good neves no
i think the january business ensured we were competitive enough to secure cl footballso i would say it was good business
and i really like raphinha too and would spend a lot of money for him if dembele leavesbut he is not as good
the thing is fati lewy ferran is nowhere near as good as someone like dembele raphinha on that right s
i am not saying it is good business do not twist my words i am saying gundogan fits perfectly becaus
good point yeah had not thought about thatthe jump from our current defence to defence with koulibaly
he is already good enough so age nothing to do with itall about using him properly
koulibaly koundepivots are difficult aye zubimendi is good but not sure if he is the one
such a good player this makes me very happy
yeah should be good on paper although they could both use a more horizontal as their partner
anyways here's a thread on neves so i do not repeat myselfagain he has the potential to be a good for barça bu
zubimendi on the other hand is not as good overall he is been playing in an inconsistent real sociedad team and is
i do not like him as a single pivot he is a very good player but not for this role
he is not average and neves is indeed very good but the wrong profile there is a difference
here's the whole thread explaining why neves is not ideal despite being a good player
good tactical coach clear foundation with youth leading the way and mixed with experience rebuil
good stuff now let us see mika jandro and arnau for the second half xavi folded hands
interestingly kessie should be a good solution to some problems that have plagued barcelona in the latter part of
i was skeptical at first but a very underrated signing he will come good
feel barça are building towards the sameon paper pedri frankie should have been good fits then with
good fitting needed and now due to the mbappe case much more available there is a big difference
yeah good option
good de jong alternative yes he is what frenkie was trying to become at barça
we will see if they continue to be but raphinha ferran auba are all very good options too
he is top class but not as good as these players also a different profile so should not get in that trident
he is very good on the ball and quite a tool for unlocking blocksnot much of a dangerous crosser i do
soler kessie are obviously not as good as frenkie nor are their ceilings that highbut they are profiles that c
comments on nico from our fanbase just make me think we do not deserve good things at all
at the beginning of the season everyone was drooling over nicoand now suddenly he is expendable and not good e
righteous dom the pretty good barça account i will take it ai thanks

all good miarma i am just teasing twas was good fun still and a good view as you say
good bloke that alan but took me for what ended up being the most expensive beer in seville though face with tears of joy
ansu fati came on in minutes he was in several good goal-scoring opportunitiesthis is not luck it is an innate
i believe no one can really rival vvd though so do not take this tweet as me saying he is better or as good as him
any pr is good pr eh
that is true but soler is not as good as frenkie and i do not like neves as a barcelona pivotrather get
potentially but still unlikelyjuventus are nowhere near as good as liverpool bayern sure yes bu
no sadly not he is very good but frenkie is the better player
good half by barça far more committed refreshed moving the ball quick with intentmemphis taking his chance
ferran used to be a more dynamic winger on the rightdribbler with a good right-footed delivery ambipedal enoug
alonso is a no does not fit the system in a possession heavy teamgalan would be a good signing but
he is a good defender not a defensive fullback but still decentbut then again people do not rat
i like angelino he had be a good option ok hand
everyone loves a good underdog story villarreal are incredibly well-run lovablehowever the truth is apart
mazraoui is almost ideal yeah pavard is very similar too but more defensive and not as good overall i
it went somewhat under the radar against rayo but i think eric garcia had a good defensive displayhe was limited
good game bad result we deserved much more it hurts but i have enjoyed my experience at the camp nou and will hop
watching mainly for victor arnau and aleix but ilias definitely electric good to see
the goal although not exactly of his making was created after his cross too no some good dribbles
great talenthe s got running and carrying power can glide past defenders good link up and a power
we are exhausted mentally and physicallybut all in our hands and we are good enough to achieve our goals
i might i have listed some good options here too but might do a piece

good on him but these are not rtable tweets eithermy engagement is fine thank you
well i will entertain them if they are good but alas james no good ones yet smile
why we are still very good tonight is an outlier and a warning but not the rule that is footballwe ll be fine
let us not be too harsh on nicohe was not good vs levante but that performance was far from what he is capable of

well yeah to a certain extent it is more that he is too good so it will always be clearly visible when he is away
not sure i agree ticks boxes of a good finisher consis
it is also interesting to see he is got a formidable xg per shot value meaning he takes up good positions to do so
i know having both dest mazraoui is very tempting and in theory it is a very good combinationsbut i am not sure
strong lineup minimal but exciting rotations huge game xavi-ball what more can we ask for feels so good to a
raphinha is not as good as dembele absolutely not better rounded and they are both a good fit

yeah they are great defenders but they have not done muchof course there were good interventions

good shout actually
before i get jumped on i firmly believe araujo can mark an era for barça he is that goodand being that good me
galan is good but would not go for him really the other two better options in my opinion
we need a good second gk who can at the very least push mats and potentially replace him if need be
this is hilarious face with tears of joy i am sweeping this btw no contestalthough there is no good pics of me here so meh
good player not sure i would really go for him as a long term
i have heard good things but never scouted in detail

puig still has his qualities agile quick technically excellent has good ball retention when his head is in it
yeah he is good too
sad we are not going for him at least the media do not think sobut even without him it will be a good summer
it is actually insane how good of a summer barcelona can have just on free agents alone i'd be perfectly content w
i would agree but his relationship with other players through our admittedly limited lense seems very good
happy to give good barça content a little push victory hand

what makes you think they don't i think they mould specific profiles but we have got good young defenders too
very good but let us not get overly excited before he even steps onto the pitch ceiling quite high
i think torres can be a very good for us so i would focus on defenders and a winger if dembele leaves
agreed but rice is still very good as is tchouameni
adama is very good at what he does but what he does is not that complex or versatileas long as the system enables

no other club is really in a good position to get him
i do not mind the cheap options we are targeting azpilicueta christensen mazraoui gaya are all good but none addr
haha although now that you mention it maybe they would love for a good pick-me-up after a loss too
face with tears of joyfor the sake of my piece let us hope they don't i want arsenal fans in a good mood
good surprise all what you have mentioned is coachable and he is technically sound
hey who is this coutinho guy at aston villa seems like a good player maybe barcelona should look into him winking facejoke
it is a shame because ferran could develop into a very good option as a without haaland
raphinha would indeed be very good
yes it is a good blueprint
always good to have options for me it all depends who we bring in if he is soldnew defenders are comi
on the other hand if a good offer comes in barça can secure options of equal or higher quality then sure selli

so far so good oh actually it is already day

sule could have been a great free coup for barça but we will end up signing christensen which is very good business
i have identified a similar thing with good cover with fdj and alves busquets could push higher which helped
and again this game shows you that with a good setup and threatening profiles on the flanks goals will comewe
still feel he could have been a good player for barça
very dynamic feels lanky but quick with big strides and chaotic in a good wayvery exciting what did you make of moriba
big opportunity for him hope he uses it as a good platform
yes they are coming off a good win but are not in the best of forms
loved the game deserved win for milan they controlled the match and kept pushinglots of good players on display too
it is good that we came to similar conclusions means we are onto something
good stuff i did a similar analysis myself and used the same examples
do not think rakitić would have been good enough to displace busquets
not that good in tight spaces and lacks the creative magical touch
that was a genuine question btw not a rhetorical one face with tears of joyso he did well i mean good does not tell me much
he is quite good i think ability and potential-wise tonali maybe better but bennacer more of a profile for that role
i think it is good to have an athletic player but that cannot be the only thing to look at it can be benef

if someone's interested here's a short thread i have done on his player profilethe full piece can be found on
if you strip down his teams to the very fundamentals they are often full of incredible individuals but individuals

there is however a place for him and i feel having him come in for the final stretch of the game at full power is
great content here writing hand light skin tone i would tend to agree but i also think he will benefit from not having the full weight of that number
apparently since there was a bus full of people wanting to meet with him the club looked at it as a mass gatherin
i have already done a full report on him albeit with very limited footage access and a thread will be coming very so

i would not discard haaland just yet unfortunately
just a note that this is not exactly a reactionary tweet to tonight's game but overall i have not seen the first ha
yeah it was always going to be a limitation to his game but this is more in a broader sense not just tonight

was not it just very limited per one workplace as in per one projectso how many can you use now
for now i would just say avoid there are better players out there for that role
as i have said just on setup quality of xavi's system barcelona go into every league game with an innate advantag
barça are actually doing rondos on the pitch to evade pressure i just cannot at this point loudly crying face
this does not mean to bash araujo and nico but just show there is a reason they were taken offit also means there

i am just spitballing names they are not all best fits but i am sure with scouting we would find some fitfaivre
not necessarily just a summer where we target high quality and fitting profiles
barcelona's ceiling under xavi is scary just with the current setup we are already incredible the blueprint is
another big point is that this is not barcelona's ceiling it is just the blueprintxavi has the profiles he need

effing gem of an article red heart dear gunners and fellow culers follow this
pretty sure i do not need to tell you this but barca absolutely should not pay anywhere near € m for lewandowski a
do not think roberto is barça level should not be anywhere near the first team luckily he will not below wages w
hope we do not get anywhere near that figure though
people need to read properly this is not a fati and benzema comparison of course ansu is nowhere near benzema's l
i have addressed that too he is nowhere near busquets in that regard and the lack of athletic power co
we are nowhere near beating liverpool and city but that is fine we will bethere was more progress in
i think this is a fair point or rather it will be soonboth abde and ilias can be big players for us in the near future
araujo is incredible but nowhere near elite on the ball
barcelona have to ensure ansu fati returns into a safe environment tonightthat means wrapping up the game so he
oh ilaix moriba still think there is a lot of talent in him and he may very well go on to become a star but safe
how about luuk de jong scoring a bicycle kick to win us the europa league title and in the process secure
mathematically no but saying they can challenge for the title would probably be pushing it a bitlet s secure top first thumbs up
i mean this should be true for everyone right face with raised eyebrow
sorry this is all i can think of right now
dembele also rarely tracks back efficiently exposing the right side and making it easy for the oppositio
right now nobut i have never stated he is ready for that being a regen means he is stylist
see i am a firm believer next season we will see a great jump hope i am right for all of our sakes
for real neves is not the right profile
if raphinha replaces outperforms dembele i will be happy to admit i was wronghowever as of right now based o

there is a world in which the sale makes sense a the right price which this isn't by far b
if there is a football article to read right now it is this by righteous dom
there are scenarios in which it could make sense but it has to be the right price the right response
our profile id is excellent and xavi is adding the right profiles this will not be an issuedepth was
i hope you are right
however talent alone is not enoughyoung players need consistency in game time they need the right management t
i agree on isak very complete profile but he had need a year or two minimum to get in the right mind
the right profile in the right stage of development is very rare haaland suretammy is very simi
yeah false alarm ferran on the right it is phew
live graphics showing ferran on the left and memphis on the right though thinking face
interesting but is he a realistic option as of right now do not think so
you can both shoot me a dm and i will confirm if you get it right not here though
i think such profiles are in demand right nowwho fits the bill too olise saka mahrez dembele an
i am honest it is your right to disagree but you do not have to be disrespectful and offensive about itsame to you
lewandowski's profile fits i am sure he had bag loads of goals for barça i would not be opposed to it on the right
we need pedri the simplest solution as of right nowbut that is not new xavi needs control because we cannot kee
you are damn right i am a nico stan because he is very much barça material
yeah john and i are best pals right winking face
yeah that sounds about right he is a winger who is being groomed to a striker or had been groomed at city
yeah because strikers can only be poachers right
surprised no but impressed yesdembele run the show left foot right foot going inside outside
it is their right but the grass is not always greener often the best place for ba
i think being broke is not exactly right laporta will get the money for a big signing and barça wi
for better or worse i think dembele will renew with barcelonaxavi clearly thinks the world of him he is right t
raphinha will be an amazing transfer for barcelonathe right type of instigator on the flanks that complements xa
as of right now with reports of new circulating do not think the club sees him as barça's long-term striker
least of his problems even if you are right
and they had every right to
i hope you see this but i wanted to ask where ferran would fit when fati returns will he be on the right wing play as
ferran's movement is so efficient no unnecessary sprinting intelligent movement to be in the right place at the right t
ferran will continue next season right and many more he has to be in barcelona for many years he is part of our future
easy they both play ansu lw ferran cf and dembele on the right ideal
ohhh you are right i messed up the dates ah well
right that is australia off the list then face with tears of joykidding we will make an effort to visit one day
ah yeah that is only in bundesliga right does not take into account other competitions i love
not sure improve is necessarily the right word but additions at full-back cb and dm are likely needed
yeah it was the sequence on the right side great stuff
adama provides width not ferran i said to his right meaning ferran and adama will be on memphis r
he can provided he is surrounded with the right profiles i'm confident he can still be a great interior
right irrelevant champions league stuff is finally out of the way this means only one thing xavi-ball next blue circlered circle
situational more than anything else but i agree memphis would be very effective with the right other two forwards
sounds about right somehow i feel the gloom and the clouds give it that special vibe tooit is very beautiful yeah
face with tears of joy yeah me and kylian are besties right
i know right we have come so far
and barça absolutely battered valencia and loves barça too right winking face
busquets getting a rest is ultimately the right thing to donow it is up to frenkie de jong nico to show xavi wh
so where does ansu fit then they want a huge signing so not there not on the right ei
kevin get back on that bike right now
another thing is width adama is a great outlet on the right but it is difficult on the leftgavi is a bulldog w
as far as i understand you are in for mazraoui too right although barça and real are always lin
true that is why i still prefer a ambipedal v specialist on the right who is creativecollado wou
ideally the right winger would be a player that can go both ways that is why dembele's situ
you mean as the right winger he is two-footed right if we can go both ways and is a creative v s
quick pollyou want the arsenal barcelona piece like right now or tomorrow morning say am vote vote vote
there simply will not be a need for dest in his usual profile on the right with traoreso i
ha i guess we will see long-term i think they are very much going in the right direction
false interior on the right
some of these aspects can be coachedunder right tutelage the system to take advantage of his obvious qualities
with haaland ferran will be a right winger adama rotational option and dembele gone
adama traore slots right into xavi's gala xi to face atletico madrid at the camp nou in what may very well be the g
yeah it is his right to explore other options but i think barça will give him more money if it comes down
seeing reports alves is likely to be sacrificed for the europa leaguenot sure that is the right call or that it w
he had slot right in easy winking face
well too bad no entry
more so than nico yes frenkie can do it well but is not necessarily best utilised that wayso i would rather have torre there
yeah i agree we could very well see an asymmetrical shape because of our winger and full-back differ
well that is the three choices we are currently chasing at least according to some reports
well then no deal and he should stay neves can stay at wolves too
it is all about reinvesting the money well which i am afraid we will not dothere are scenarios in whi

offloading deadwood is as important for barça as buying well this summer i feel we keep saying this every window
and now mika araujo tandem of the future please play well folded hands
potentially although both can work well even together
why not he had work well in that system too
so far mbappe messi tchouameni the most common answerssome de ligts and van dijks too saw one morata as well interesting
the sale makes sense largely financially not sportinglysoler would likely do well but not better in frenkie's r
eid mubarak has hope you are well and have found a shop for my inevitable shirt gift red heart
jordi alba and memphis work quite well on the left as depay gives alba both the space to run into and occasionally
i am pretty sure it was confirmed oh well we will see
i think he is still decent in that an aubameyang upgrade would likely do well considering the technical
well done miarma winking face
dembele is a playmaker though and in our system he is supposed to be too i prefer him to raphinha as well
ferran moves extremely well can still strike through the ball with power despite the misses this seasonjust o
as soon as we calmed down and started setting the tempo the chances started appearingwe do not do well in end-to

oh i thought that was already well known anyway i can delete the tweet if necessary
barça's interiors have not been able to time their runs well arriving into space well is key here because the bloc
no easy way to break down a man backline which cadiz have been deploying well taking a page out of frankfurt's
he is decently well built and has power but aerial duels are far more about timing reading and awaren
puig can be a fine interior with the proper setup around him but currently does not function well in
might be slightly over my budget madanis but thanks fr the food recommendations i will need those as well
hm not sure i would risk ityou re my only hope of getting a serious and well informed opinion o
all the praise i have been giving xavi has not suddenly become irrelevant overnight barça are still extremely well s
unreal scenes what a night for emery what a night for villarreal what a night for football congratulations well deserved clapping hands
yeah we did not play well because we were not allowed to play our gameas soon as we are not the ones sett
nico gets a well deserved start absolutely love to see ithe s far from pedri still behind gavi but i adore h
well pedri is quite something
that went about as well as expected mate face with tears of joy
xavi is succeeding at getting the best out of them dembele as well as the veterans are players of
do not think xavi will immediately go for changes we are doing well considering the opposition's defensive level
he absolutely is notwith a creative midfield and fbs it would work decently well but the workload wou

generally i think ansu fati has all the characteristics of a great nohe s lethal moves well attacks space
i hope xavi gives the forward trident of ansu ferran dembele a go it would be incredibly complete well bal
waving hand paris flag francetravel agent dom is back you know all those crazy rumours on mbappe joining barcelona yeah well
he can make runs from rw too and can dribble as well i would prefer dembele and raphinha on rw too t
i think with raphinha in as dembele replacement it still works quite well ansu ferran raphinha is well balanced
he is moving incredibly well poacher instincts recognising exploiting space dragging markers u

if xavi wants a false then he might as well invest in it properly and get one that can be the best false on th
tactical analysis proposition blue circlered circle fc barcelona white circle️ real madrid as many accounts explored the game really well i will focus
not sure about best in europe but well optimised and balanced
i am still amazed at how well ferran torres moves around the pitchhe s a very hardworking selfless forward with
absolutely he needed and deserved such a game i love eric but frenkie needs praise as well victory hand
well i think everyone is tweeting about this tbh
exactly and i remember the abuse i got for saying barça would eventually recover and play well in
nah i would not go for it obviously he had still do well but our team is going in a different direct
yeah does that mean he was great tonight where have i said he did anything well are you saying he
ferran goes inside as well it is not ideal to have two right-footers on the leftdest has been quit
backwards passes break compactness when executed well i would say they force you to step ou
he actually fits the system quite well too
ha this is very true and i am guilty of it as well but the potential does seem there from what i have been
i would rather not invest all the money into a single player but oh well
well as it turns out navid was our guest in the special lamasia episode of
great analysis on dest well written interesting to how dest will progress in this role
i would love to see him lw with auba and ferran or ferran and adama think it would work very well indee
well lots of players will have to leave i do not see braithwaite or ldj lasting for too l
that would be the case but he is not exactly the ideal partner for frenkie eithermight as well give nico a shot then
ah well my point on the guy still stands
and the more he performs well and the less the crowd whistles him the more likely he is to stayat this point i
barcelona are so well structured it is incrediblethe difference between now pre-xavi is humongous do not tell a
i would rather have a winger there to combine with dest but could very well be gavi aye
i do not think either of them works well with haaland and mbappeyou think you are winni
not saying having both would somehow make them worse but them two together do not work that well toge
congrats and well deserved clapping hands
hoping for a psg win but realistically real madrid are still the better teamemphasis on team too because well
do not think it will be a long-term thing but he is done well
as i have said luuk made more sense than auba but structurally barça were still very well set up
i see yes that is sometimes the case they do not really cope with change that well
fati ferran and then perhaps a new winger i mean laporta will want a big signing either way might as well
did decently well but would not go for him
well big talents are worth investing in if we don't someone else willalves is how
i am hilarious what can i say but notice how i have managed to use pngs well this time
cesc is and arda well arda is that
i think it can be yes it has the mechanisms to escape the press as well as exploit space
do not think he fits that does not run nearly as much nor does he read the game well enough defensivel
after a little bit of a post-transfer window break i wrote about what marcelo did so well yesterday to help real madrid
yeah most of the work he does is indeed indirect involvementto move well is not necessarily to mov
yeah everything is easier within a well constructed systemand i am already being labelled as alves
well barça scored screamers that is why overall atletico did not create much
well it is still far too early to say but let us hope he can keep it up
well covered at right-back though not sure about that especially if he does not trust dest at all
that means i have done my job well
of course this also does not mean it is grimaldo but rather someone like that could very well be tagliafico too
i am aware of that but he will do the job decently well as long as he does the simple thingsif luuk de
i will say though he is been inconsistent and not as effective as we would hopedbut bo
no reason for his passing to be less effective higher up on the contrary if he can retain the high
look messi and neymar do not work hard and have not been as effective as they should bebut psg's season is done
that is exactly the thing with him he can and has been effective but what you see is what you get from
it is never but it is much more than haaland needs to be fed to be effective hence
if the board is serious about supporting xavi nothing will happen without his stamp of approvalthe same is true
the frankfurt jokes do not amuse me so i will probably delete this tweet soon i'd appreciate some serious comments first though flexed biceps
do not know will personally i have always wanted a t-rex to say why so serious before separating someon
we need to have a serious talk about jordi albafor all his deficiencies which are by and large psychological t
not even lionel messi can make psg a serious clubthere s actually some solace in that if you look deep enough
no we give you cash and dembele winking facebesides this was not a serious tweet al smirking face
let us not kid ourselves losing araujo would likely push barça into throwing serious money
nothing funny about it mate i am dead serious
i think both bernardo and gundogan fit what barça are looking for but i would rather invest into other areas to be honest
what i am way more optimistic than i am even supposed to beto be honest did not expect the res
i like that too to be honest it is a decent rotational optionstill if your main goals are to keep dembele and
it is a tough trade off to be honest i'd rather invest into a young project striker but i think th
i do not really see him as the focal point to be honest
hm interesting has raphinha played on the left often i am not aware of it to be honest
i am loving this approach from the barça board to be honest here's our offer take it or leave it we stand by
i would report your coach for that setup to be honest man shrugging
i would not drop adama to be honest
to be perfectly honest i am not sure i will have to scout him more to confidently assess
why them two specifically i would have to look into it more to be honest
i do not see the value of kessie to be honest kamara instead of kessie though if we really go for another midfielder ok hand
i absolutely love that barcelona's asking price for frenkie de jong is reportedly very highif we are going to los
ansu fati off the benchansu fati goalyou love to see it
i would love to see collado get at least a preseason at barça he would slot in the creator role they would lose with
and your point i'd love kamara but we are not getting him

i would love for it to happen but he is likely leaving the club
i love you ansu fatithe young king is back crown

i love it although i feel ferran is a future still
i would love that trio but ferran in a proper role not a false oneand thank you
current team no i am assuming the club would love the likes of kounde and de ligt or skriniar koulibaly

cannot express how much i love xaviman is absolutely battering real madrid at the bernabeu and yet he is havin

thoughts on eric garcia any hope for him to improve the defensive side enough to be a top tier player
i hope aubameyang gets a proper game tonightyes he made his debut vs atletico madrid but that was in extreme ci
strange that even with the absence of lenglet and umtiti we are yet to see certain graduates soon though i hope
i trust xavi knows what he is doing with kessie we will see
i trust xavi has a reason but i would have preferred kamara
in other words do not trust him hahafair enough but again us getting linked with the
i have already explained why i do not really trust the ansu-haaland-ferran trio to be extremely successfulit can be
it is not us who need to trust in him it is all on xavido you really think he will play dest as his fir
we are all villarreal tonight all the way yellow heartyellow heart
yeap broken heart
see why are you all so toxic have i struck a nerve i mean you talk barça every ot
ferran on the left is not the same as ferran down the centre or on the rightthe worst option in my opinion
memphis down the middle changes the complexity of barcelona's attack and forces us to restructure the forward line
yeah depends who is playing down the middle and on the other wing but would not mind resting ferran a bit
memphis on the left not down the middle
the problem is where do you put him on the left fati down the middle auba ferran the big h pot
incredibly impressive xavi will surely keep an eye on him he is got running power and technical quality too very intriguing
that is more like it knew he had be there somewhere on your list ha one to keep an eye on for sure
no this is not based on data it is based on eye testmaybe we see different things then
one to keep an eye on think barça retained a buyback clause or something not entirely sure
madrid barca history repeats itself a team on a steep rise the other trying to find some substance to cheer
moleiro torre will join an already excellent young core of players at barça i think many of us are taking that
partially it can be but none of our midfielders are defenders first so some of these core aspects need to be drilled into them
tactics are important at the core of barcelona's transformationhowever that is nothing without morale xavi ca
great to sit down and interview on how his real betis team functions and the deep core philosophy of how he set

oh hello neal have not seen you tagged in a tweet with me for a while smile
ha must be it i am pretty confident i will win the bet though smile

simple as eh gavi tho smiling face with heart-eyes
keyword is in the title ferran and  movement ” smiling face with sunglassesdashing away
also i am aware this has little to do with your actual question but made me think of it grinning face with sweat
soon i have written the pieces months ago but never got around to posting the thread grinning face with sweat
excellent read grinning face with big eyes
meh they laugh at us we laugh at them that is the nature of this relationship
we have all had a laugh or two on real madrid's expense but do not forget they still have a warchest ready to be unlea

exactly cl final to worry about and you are in my mentions because of barça's finances face blowing a kiss this club rent free in your head winking face
will not lose sleep over it pal face blowing a kiss

i do not care my dude get me my shirt and as far as i am concerned take haaland too winking face
have you beat by a couple days winking face
drastic but winking face
think there might be a couple of things that could still improve it i reckon winking face
croatia winking face
is that a psg kit alan or do my eyes deceive me winking face
i do not mind that outcome winking face
everyone stressing about this only for barça to sign haaland anyway man shruggingso calma winking face
xavi-ball go br br too winking face

what do you reckon how much will you have to pay for my haaland shirt winking face
cheers folks and do not worry it is all sorted winking face
hey come outside winking facei told you though
you are alright i guess winking faceseriously though congrats
no fingers off ai we'll give you lenglet and umtiti though winking face
the same way we will break them in a couple of days winking face
strong gala xi winking face
and yet benzema has the qualitative superiority winking face
you forgot sweden in between winking facebut yes hopefully my scouting and transfer work will not go unnoticed
nah this was my signature move winking face
nico winking face
i appreciate the comments but you are also assuming a lot without even reading my piece winking face
would not really be a neal tweet without it would it now winking face
andreas and dave buddy winking face and yes we can face with tears of joyi mean you can try man shruggingface with tongue
not happening winking face
sounds tough yeah take one for the team winking faceface with tears of joy
ha no did not mean to accuse you of anything but i will take credit of putting a bug in your ear some time ago winking face
no one said it have to be the strikers who score as long as we score winking face
not yet but it will be from your side in tb the summer winking face
congrats you have got a better chance at that than haaland winking face
fortunately we will get him winking face
one underappreciated change at barcelona is how we approach the marketthe cheap transfers performing is not a hug
this is the shift in mentality we keep talking about even though teams push us to our limits squeeze every last

if barcelona manage to both renew dembele and sign raphinha that would be an insane couple of dealsthey re both
given how xavi has reshaped our full-back roles borna sosa would indeed be a great fithis delivery is insane
dembele's ball-striking is actually insane thoughso
the only concern is who will be on the market when we come looking for a replacement for yet another ageing striker
yeah fair enough i agree with that as i have mentioned all of those things as aspects that concern m
yeah that is my main concern too
and that is my biggest concern around barça b at the momentunder pimienta the results were not always extraordina

as a dembele replacement i think something like that is the plan given interest in raphinha

interesting comparison i would have to look into it but you piqued my interest

and none of them will be able to match his wages
i will never forget that
we will add at least defenders this summer too if one of koulibaly or kounde really does come it will still be a massive boost
mbappe will end up at real madrid he has tosaying no staying could stall his career massively he is ready for
he will still be in a relatively consistent rotation but also behind the new and behind fati
it will obviously be busy very busy but most deals will be smaller scale compared to what the fans might b
i feel we will get a cb regardless koulibaly or nothe ll be the fifth choice at best
now i am aware of the fact alonso somehow remains the priority but i am hopeful we will end up with someone like gaya
once we lose alba and whoever is there to take over struggles to replicate his contribution people will
he can and has played as a left-back but we will seefor now i prefer him as a centre-back
barcelona will soon move on from piqué as it should be with a player who is over years of age defender or other
he will play one more for sure and if he retains his best form he will be difficult to displace
the only factor to take into account is age barça still will not have an elite centre-back in his prime but if eric
they will get grimaldo and azpilicueta lewy and then we will see about koulibalybesides tagliafico
ansu fati lewandowski ousmane dembele trio will absolutely destroy defenceslewy may not be a future prospect

busquets should i feel will get rested tonightdon t get me wrong he is been absolutely sensational under xavi
he will be a danger in the box even without speedbut i would wager he will stay pacey very long into his career
not necessarily but grimaldo will be alba's subsidiary i am pretty suredest is still fighting to s
ok we give you dembele for free and some cash since he will not renew and you give us saka deal deal a
there are other options ranging from safe-ish to bonkers that i will reveal in a thread once i am back homethe tr
haaland would absolutely fit the system but would it be worth it guess we will see or we won't man shrugging
great talent will only grow
i do not think he will be played as the pivot nor should he be
they will try to get both
do not think so if haaland does not join we will more likely go for kounde
true but laporta will find the money for some reason i am not too concerned about the financeswe
i have a feeling not all three of dest mazraoui and azpilicueta will be at the club at the same timewe ll see
grimaldo is coming will not say but i am pretty sure he istop cb joins only if that specific top striker doesn't
i do not think all three will be here i would say azpilicueta may not join and if that happens dest stays
the problem is that is never going to happeneven if haaland fails we will bring someone e
not sure but it will get signed thumbs up
although we will get one big signing whether that is him or someone else remains to be seen but we will get one for sure
he maybe azpilicueta will make for an exceptional scoop getting both for free is fantastic value for moneyit
i reckon it will be signed sooner rather than later
for example adama fits but will not be nor should he be the long-term option i'm not saying they don
ferran torres goal first of many i guarantee itthe hype train will leave the station soon do not miss itlocomotive
agreed with the first one not the second it is unlikely he will continue this goal-scoring

what i will also say is that fati is flying slightly under the radar now because of the injurieshe is a football

yeah and the same will happen with a certain other player cannot wait
yes although i am guessing he will be an interior first

in terms of who i think joins still insist we will see the players i have been mentioning for months christensen

nah mbappe will play at madrid we will see about haaland i still think he goes to barça
no not yet but i will do something on him once it is clear he will sign
absolutely i will keep everyone posted
this boy is giving me joy definitely will be proud
thank you and i will expand on it in a thread because the piece was getting quite long
i will also follow his development with interestchristensen is a nice blend of defensive traits technical physi
that is fair once we can sustain this form and be regularly dominant then we will be comfortable saying it
i think dest staying might affect mazraoui but not azpi the latter will be signed if
if dembele leaves which is still very likely i feel barcelona will need to buy a similar

yeah i am not denying it it is not a bad combo because it works to an extentand i will admit i would ha
i never said we will get them all at once relaxbut the raphinha type will be needed howeve
xavi wanting a winger like raphinha is an excellent sign he is identified the needs of the team will act according

nah it is not that i want him it is more i feel he will sign
sure but at this rate it will still go up because he is trying to and is getting into positions to score

on ronald araujo i think he can become a complete defender despite his limitations on the ball will be a pilla
he will not but he also will not be there to try
still cheap all things considered would have costed million what they will give for him now

i still like eric but will not deny he needs to improve defensively i'd say it is more likely araujo improves on the
dest has been quiet in the alves role he will need time and coaching to improvehe s not moving optimally to recei
i think it still depends on dest having rbs roberto is not necessary and that will dictate how many
luckily my friend we will get both
let us also not forget barcelona are targeting mazraoui who will come in as a still young player entering his prime
amazing to see eric garcia in the lineup we have missed him dearlynot sure he will start but if there was ever an o
given he is already improving since his time at b i would say he will still get better he will have to anyway
i will say that gvardiol and araujo pairing would have been amazing albeit somewhat youngboth are physically domi

yes we will go for the win as it should be
of course but let us first get top four and then we will see

if you cannot see it is on the up now you will pretty soon
initially rw but then it will depend on whether or not xavi makes it work
yup there are downsides even to such deals like his injury and who the third forward should be we will see
ha fair we will get them too not marquee options but azpilicueta mazraoui and gaya grimaldo i think
yeah i think he will stay but we will see how xavi fits him into his jigsaw
please do not jinx me i am sure that will somehow happen or we will announce haaland or messi or something
i will also say this has nothing to do with any pl laliga or bundesliga taxsome profiles simply function better i

i think the money will be there in my mind it is all about champions league football and whether
i will explain in the piece but there is one particular aspect of arteta's blueprint i would want barcelona to replicate
you will see i have got something more specific in mind than basic structure
i would argue that will not be the end of itpending some departures potentially all three of umtiti lenglet even p
i think azpilicueta christensen mazraoui will all join barcelona in the summerhonestly this alone makes for
at this stage it is becoming more and more apparent riqui puig will absolutely have to go on a loan if he wants to
we will see iniesta xavi and busquets midfield in the year of our lord what a time to be alive
one thing i will say potentially in favour of the signing is again the double pivotif thiago can be deployed a
i think we will have the money that is the smallest problem laporta will get the funds so
last night proved that barcelona can and will score goals eventuallyyes we lack a clinical finisher but ansu crossed fingers
would not be so sure it is possible but we will see
fair i think xavi will want kounde thoughand if we miss out on haaland we will get a different marquee signing
yeah but too expensive if we go for someone that expensive it will be kounde
loved ferran torres yesterdaythe way he moves and recognises where space will open and how to exploit it is esse
eyes i will have to rewatch that goal then
i am certain araujo will inevitably renew his contract he only wants barcelona and you have to respect that about h
i still think this will be exactly our lineup
at this point the bridge has already been burned i am guessing there is no coming backif he absolutely will play
would not surprise me although seeing reports both auba and adama will start on the bench
i will check him out thank you thumbs up
that does make sense i mean honestly i do not see araujo leaving they will give him more m
i will also say it is likely easier to coach araujo to become a better progressor than it is to
yeah i would say he will mitigate the lack of full-backs by tinkering with the systembut that does not change
i think his performance in front of goal will definitely improve with more experiencebut
yeah my second and third parts of the tweet will address that have them scheduled for a bit later
we will see if he wants to leave not sure milan is a very convenient place for him football things aside
ferran torres will still be a massive signing for barcelona and cannot believe some are actually debating whether he
all i see here is dembele and stands and that is how it will should belet s see what xavi has to say ab
i do but they are not leaving now they will in the summer or at least someone willsadly that's
something tells me barcelona will sign someone like grimaldo out of nothing if dembele leavesdoubt it would be anoth
haaland will not sign for real but yeah psg have indeed played themselves
i will also say that this is not really prime aubameyang so that will inevitably affect his work-rate efficiency p
he may not leave permanently but i do not see lenglet staying with the squad next seasonunl

you can complain all you want i'm telling them not to do it here under my tweet

because we targeted names not profiles

it is likely we see him as the overlapping lb unless ferran can go to the outside on the left which is not that like

of course he had say that but it does not make it truealso dembele is very much a ball to feet player despite his pace

it is sometimes it is a proper double even albeit not consistently so
since we lost neymar and never replaced him with a wingerand we still do not have a proper left-winger
again would not say either can replicate alba's contributionthey are not high-flying full-backs with elite final
not sure either are ideal for barcelona but i am starting to lean towards grimaldo over gaya in the alba successor
would not say they are similar profiles both are elite defenders but vvd is far more complete

depends many seem to like that option but he is not exactly a penetrative player nor do
so what that does not make his talent any lesser
xavi must have realised he really was not on the required level and or his competition were much more fitting to his own plans
maybe but i am not sure that changes much for barcelona
given the role s xavi's no s have it is difficult seeing thiago fit that frameworkhe s not one to attack space

gavi as lw is not exactly something new it is how you get the best of alba while still having width on both sides
we have seen in recent times that even with loads of firepower our defence meant we would not get far
might not be a popular opinion but reports xavi wants full-backs an elite centre-back perhaps at haaland's expens
would not be surprised if we saw this tbh
banega is unique and i do not think rakitić fits that profile as much
have not watched him nearly consistently enough to form a highly educated opinion but he is no pivot
did not like kessie in that advanced role between the lines felt largely underutilised a bit lostbut if barça
i do not want him to clarify it to me but then do not say we are well-covered in that
i want him to say we need to be smart about his game time that does not mean he is not fit or
i am not saying it is but then you are straightforward about it and do not play games until the last second

i got the first three letters on my first try and then legit had misses in a row somehow got it
wonder who plays lb then without alba
you have got half an hour and then start pedalling kevin we are counting on you
yeah we have options fortunatelybut then ferran gets dropped
the worst thing barcelona could do with frenkie de jong is sell him and then attempt to find a direct replacement
regarding the double pivot that is indeed the change in system i was alluding toand it has crossed my mind a lon
ha nono this is very basic stuff indeed
indeed ticks almost all the boxes
indeed one of my more legendary edits
can confirm this is indeed me explaining xavi ball to my better half thumbs up
thank you and indeed they are tactically fascinating
true yes their mentality is indeed different
indeed that must be the case
real madrid getting mbappe for free even if it is indeed on astronomical wages is a stroke of brilliancenot onl
ha braithwaite is very underrated indeed yeah me too crossed fingers
sadly yes but sacrifices are also necessary barça's mistakes still haunting them as is only fair
to be fair he is far from an ordinary year-old man shruggingbut yes
fair enough talent-wise dembele is superior whether he can sustain it and be consistent is anyone's guess
fair handshakevictory hand
that is also fair i am cautiously optimistic
we should still respect what he tried to achieve with what he was given which to be perfectly fair was an absolu

it is probably very unrealistic but if barça could somehow sign two out of lewandowski raphinha and koulibaly that
excellent yeah but cannot happen in a single window
i literally said he should be phased out we should have gotten a replacement but did
always said dembele is better but if he is leaving raphinha is the best choice to replace him
meh i have got a lot of barça shirts but none newer than i completely stopped buying
i cannot make that decision for you but a ferran shirt sounds nice victory hand
ah gotchayeah i still think there is loads to be optimistic about but every time i say that people go ballistic
cannot even imagine that but now they have a warchest ready to be unleashed on multiple positionsso
of course but he has the foundations for success too

i liked it too but remember it was vs men
at least at the top level million is quite a bit for a yo in his last year of contact but

ah where is the mistake now it is becoming annoying but what can you do
twitter has that option built in but personally i use zlappo
