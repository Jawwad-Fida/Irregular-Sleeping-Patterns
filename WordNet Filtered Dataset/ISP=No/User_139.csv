the lovers the dreamers the ones who refuse to give up on hope even when they are going through hell those are my people

antony the johnsons hope there is someone later archive via
i hope you are not waiting for me to say something interesting
every hope and dream folded in a fist
when hope is the threat
i hope it is okay if i am sad for a little bit longer
when the shower will not wash the inexplicable sadness away so you sit and hope it washes you away instead
i blew some kisses on a breeze i hope they find you
sometimes hope will glint briefly flashing like a lapwing's belly in the sun
i suppose the best that any of us can hope for is to be remembered with fondness
there will always bea sunrise and youthat gives me hope
i hope you will not mind that i will always have at least fifteen book on my night stand
sometimes pain is a long road without lights but hope burns gently in the distance
every day on this side of the dirt gives me hope
i do not want you to say it but promise me
there is wonder in nakednessbare trees in winter naked thoughts and the promise of unadorned touch
i do not trust a single thought that i think
an entanglement of trust so flawlessly meshed like breath like touch like a perfect kiss
i have only recently started to trust avocados again they disappoint so often but are occasionally majestic
sorry i tapped out in the middle of that trust fall
thick densities of trees create the pockets of stillness i so desire
there is a butterfly whirring away wildly inside my rib cage and i have no desire at all to set her free
imagine emotions swirling as little birds of desire
you are not here anymore but a part of you is still in my heart a part of you will always remain with me
my heart belongs to fall and winter
oh my heart x
as long as you hold my heart i can breathe
my heart is weary but is in it for the long haul
no one knows about the gardens in your heart eternally dying
i hear your heart beat i am with you red heart x
distance is nothing if you travel by heart
oh a swift reference red heart
wednesday evening where is your heart
the ravens pecking at what is left of my heart
melancholy calls for you constantly asking you to make a place for her in your heart she has her tight grip on your soul
when i hear the ocean my heart beats stronger and nothing else matters
your great appreciation of all things green and from the forestand your kind heart
thank you for your patience as i try to get to the bottom of this messy heart of mine endurance
you hold a very special place in my heart
it is always the swallowsthat make my heart race with their furious fusion into the vast darkening bluereally
today my heart is dreaming a dream
yes my heart is always firmly emblazoned on my sleeve
i have a heart condition i feel too much
come sleep in my heart hide your words in my poems
i will leave my heart here as a shoulder to lean on until you decide where to settle
when i call you gorgeous i am talking about your looks when i call you beautiful i am talking about that heart of you
oh clairered heart i'll give again when i am paid next x
the sadness is comingfrom inside the heart

my heart was not made to thrive in places that might destroy it
my heart belongs to only one boy
please come cover here and be my friend red heartred heartred heartred heart
that is so mutual red heart
this is how lonely feels it is ice cold tentacles frozen around your heart squeezing out every last drop
the heavy beat of my iron heart

can we hit pause and restart when my heart can make sense of things again
i am interested in what is turned your heart into a stone

i keep coming back to this one red heart
purging through everything specially my heart
they say home is where the heart is but i am not sure that is always true
i am careful about who has access to my heart you have no idea what she is been through and i will protect her like
i never thought i would find a girl like her but here she is offering her heart to me she sees my imperfections my sca
bless your heart amy if i am half the woman she was i would die happyyou are all of these things too red heartxx
your heart was not madeto be collateral damage
your heart is important to me that's the tweet
how is your heart today
i could write the most sentimental words about it but it is still loneliness and it is eating my heart
i talk a lot about my heart but tonight it sits quietly and patiently in a room that is devoid of oxygen yet it is still eager to please
my heart is heavy already
today my heart cannot sleep
yeats red heart
i want to crawl inside your heart and stay a while
i think my heart ought to win the pulitzer prize
her jagged little heart
i also fight with my heart
heart carved from brimstone
the way memories creep up on you leaving your heart filled with nothing but sorrow
i am playing it now on spotify red heart
white heart xx
if only i can make your heart beat better
silence orange heart
i wish i did not feel every damn thing every damn daythis big fucking heart of mine will be the death of me
have you ever felt another's heart break and wish you could take on their anguish
my heart hurts so as always i will ignore it until such times as i feel hopeful of better days
some nights it feels like the pain is going to keep eating at you until there'll be nothing left inside that heart of you
dancing with my children in the kitchen as we make pancakes on a sunday morning red heart
my daughter does this before her swimming lesson and my heart melts every single time
breaks heart over song plays it on repeat
a rolling stone of a heart
the slow rush of your kissand my racing heart
my heart is a home with the door kicked in
my arms are always open for you red heart
the piece of my heart that is yours but you are not here to have it
i can feel your broken heart from here i will help you carry it for a while if you like
my heart was broken by every single dog i ever loved when they had to shuffle off this mortal coil
i wish we were alone in a cabin in the middle of nowhere moments away from getting eaten by bears

i am tired i have had a really long day and i would give my eye teeth to have a hand to hold and a body to bequest
i am drawn in as helpless as a length of slender thread through the eye of a needle
each winter the geese have more beach to occupy and less island to eye
my spirit was forged in survival
it is joyous you are here with me in spirit sweet thing x
there is no point hiding your tenderness
i feel sorry for anyone who has no time for tenderness

i am having a cup of tea on the sofa my dog is asleep and snoring are you coming over need a hug
a freshly tumble dried hoodie so i can remember what a hug feels like
i will never not want a huge heartfelt hug
if you can hug your mother please do i have been too long without mine
i need a hug more than i need oxygen
i sleep more deeply inside the embrace of a lover's arms
see now i am jealous as get outhope you got to embrace those hugslucky girl x
i imagine you look glorious in the warm embrace of a spring meadow
hell flickers through a crowd of angry mouths
a wild wind whips eagerly by my ears stripping my lungs while wet life huddles in the neat hedgerows
a touch so wild like waves crashingonto the shore
i hate to be where you are not
some people will hate your inner beauty
the intrigue of new people is not lost on me even though i hate of them
it is disturbing and disappointing how many men hate women
i feel for those who do not go a little mad sometimes
have you ever felt that woken up from a giant sleep and everything in the world has gone quite mad i feel that
it is crazy how our paths have never crossed feeling you regardless x
like a night when you have to duck down an alley until a disturbed mob passes
poetry keeps me from going completely insane
but what was normal in the eveningby the morning seems insane

i do not care about your dramajust put your ladders away and keep your cat out of my garden
this is a form of journaling i do not care what you say

sometimes i am so dizzy with the fear of losing everything sea the sky forests all of the rivers and my loved o
if i do not think of something interesting soon i fear i might lose you
i fear you may have misquoted the bard
i want to say apologising but i fear a retort
i fear losing all of my memories more than i fear death i am scared of becoming a living ghost
i dropped a dress size by only eating existential dread
patient and afraid but still through it all attentive to the irredeemable
i am not afraid grab my hand lets jump down the rabbit hole together we will get lost for a little while forget about it
i always feel that i am on the edge of something and i am afraid of what awaits me when i inevitably fall to the bottom
a midge caught in my eyelash neither of us sure who is the more afraid
noli timere don't be afraid séamus heaney's last words i think about this a lot and i miss his wisdom
noli timeredon't be afraid séamus heaney
i said that i was not afraid but i was lying
let us start with women on the verge of a nervous breakdown

nooo that is not at all where i was coming from weary face
my six year old boy has three girlfriends weary face
it was a clarins lipstick weary face
i could sing you the entire soundtrack from beginning to end weary face
maybe i will wear a scolds bridle with nothing but metal spikes facing inside and out that'll teach me
wear red lipstick and carry a sword
i never forget those who bore the brunt with me
i am tired of holding all of my breath inside a clenched fist
i am tired and falling asleep but why is your tongue not on me
i am so tired of being vulnerable of learning lessons through exposing wounds
i think i am tired of many things
i am tired of being the strong one i want to be a noodle
i am growing tired of carrying these heavy bones with me every day when all i really want is to be kissed
i am too old and tired to do mostly anything
nights when you are emotionally and physically tired to deal with life are the worst
sad because you are tired because you are sad
i do not remember what not being tired feels like
i have acted so weird in the past few months like every day a different mood mostly sad
my wife's favorite music is s british alternative and the specific genre is known as upbeat sad bastard
dusk has a big sad brown eyes
keep those sad songs far away from me
my default is sad cannot seem to shake that fucker
wanna come over and be sad in silence together
sad girls have blue eyes and brown hair
i really loved it i found it very moving and poignant very sad at times
there is nothing so sad and beautiful as throwing away an empty ink pen — like laying a noble soldier to rest
i cannot even remember when sad became my default setting
i am so very sad and this world is so very fucking unfair
the pages of this book i am reading were once part of a forest and now i do not think i have ever felt more sad
i do not dance on graves but i have been known to listen to sad music in cemeteries
i am sorry always better tomorrow xx

there are deer in the woodsthat i will never seeone nighti'll set off past the meadow into the treesand nobody will call me back
yep always a close call
i call my mates wankers grimacing face
actions that speak louder than words naw i want them to scream at the top of thier lungs
there is a certain irony in growing quiet when all you want to do is scream at the top of your lungs
is it too soon to weep over tomorrow
some nights there is only crying and there is nothing else that you can do about that
welcome to parenthood oh my god i wish they were grownloudly crying faceoh my god i wish they were little againloudly crying face

i do not drink but now i am singing show me the way to go home in solidarity
you are not who you thought you would be
i have always felt i am not from these parts like a blow-in to this universe
the weird irony of feeling isolated is that you are not alone in that feeling
i have reached a place where words do not find me and the past is a journey i cannot quite remember
my little son does not speak much but there are more phrases inside him that cannot escape than there are seahorses in the ocean

i buried it deeper this time so it does not hurt anymore
and i woke up in your arms this morning but you were not there
do not look back this is not you
some days dawn weird and there is not one thing you can do about it
you deserve someone who tells you what they need and does not make you play guessing games
maybe we can burn bras again not books
i am sure like me even you must have had those days days when you were wearing sadness the whole day but no one seeme
why are you so deep there are forests inside me that no one wants to explore
i offer no commentary only understanding
i have no opinion about what is going on in popular culture my life is complicated enough

there is something really irish about a warm hearth
noone knows about the nights you spend falling deeper into yourself detaching from the whole world
i wonder what my ex's wife thinks about him asking me out for lunch next week
noone knows about the nights you spend overwhelmed by your emotions that it feels like you are slowly drowning in them

i am old enough to remember when the wingdings font translated some really weird shit
some of my thoughts are like the taste of aluminium foil between my teeth
i have been much happier sitting quietly alone with a book in hand and my dog's head on my lap than i have been in some entire relationships
some days i feel like the black rock at midnight on which the waves break
some books deserve a standing ovation
some days you cannot stand looking at your own reflection because you despise the person you have turned into
some days we feel less loved and everything reminds us of every hurt we have held today is like that
some days you wake up feeling empty and helpless and those days are always too heavy you find yourself wanting to stay in
some words are made of flesh

more fruitthan stone more yolkthan lacquered shell
it needs more ink to be fully comfortable
always wishing everyone the best of luck more smiles than they ever saw coming
it was much more than infatuation
tell yourself that you deserve more until it is loud enough to believe and scares the takers away

who is the best band you have seen live
today's view
take me where the memories cannot hurt anymore
the road you take

anything always everything everywhere here take my hand
same take me with you

maybe hell is among us
you can close your eyes and pretend it is and nobody can stop you

my self destruct has always been on auto-pilot
it is always quiet in the aftermath
the body always bears the brunt
running always running like water downhill
always pulled in by the blackest star
particles of us are constantly turning to dust
your presence brings me peace please stay forever
stop stealing our thunder
life is knowing how to keep going and art is knowing when to stop
they stopped building hearts like mine during the renaissance period
can anyone else feel electricity in the air tonight it feels like the air might catch fire
where do the wires end and our veins begin
in the end it was easy to let go of vigilance those endless disputes compulsion overridden by allurements
everything comes to solitude in the end
when is it going to end this is torture
my advice open the windows and listen to the rain your soul needs this
can you hear them
do you hear the stormneutralisten closely
be here quiet my mind
listening takes practice and patience
